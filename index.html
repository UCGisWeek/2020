Join us for a 3-day virtual conference which celebrates the GIS work of the University of California faculty, staff, students, and alumni. The University of California system is holding an inaugural UC GIS Week on November 17th – 19th, 2020. We will celebrate all things mapping and geospatial. In light of the challenging times, we are coming together virtually to share our work with our community. Researchers, students, industry partners, alumni, and community mappers, will share their accomplishments and inspire others through their mapping.</p>
                        <p class="lead">The event is free to attend. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/uc-gis-week-tickets-125668693445?aff=affiliate1" target="_blank"><b>REGISTER HERE</b></a>.</p>

An early challenge for the company was figuring out a feasible route across the Sierra Nevadas.  How did the route of the Central Pacific Railroad evolve from a mere concept to the busy, as-built track it is today?  We describe our QGIS workflow and the technical challenges in georeferencing 21 historical maps of varying size, scale, and accuracy, across three time periods.</p>

However, many traffic engineers are not trained to be GIS specialists and GIS visualization frequently becomes the bottleneck in our research. In this poster, I will present some of our recent case studies that uses GIS tools (both conventional and new, browser-based) to visualize a variety of traffic phenomena and welcome advice in incorporating the most cutting-edge developments.</p>

We observed gay migration in LG people migrating based on regional gay-friendliness, while the fit or misfit of personal attitudes and regional gay-friendliness predicted migration in straight people.</p>
