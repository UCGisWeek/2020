	<li>Joakim A. Weill: Joakim (Jo) Weill is a PhD candidate at UC Davis working on the economics of environmental inequalities. His research leverages microeconomic tools and causal inference methods to study (i) how environmental changes impact the most vulnerable populations, and (ii) the distributional impacts of public policies that aim to increase environmental resilience. Current projects investigate the unequal adaptation to flood risk in the United States and the distributional impacts of the flood insurance program, as well as the economic origins of inequalities in air pollution exposure. Prior to his doctoral studies, Jo worked as a consultant at the World Bank’s Environment and Natural Resources division. He holds masters in environmental sciences and environmental engineering from AgroParisTech, France.</li>
