					and (ii) the distributional impacts of public policies that aim to
					increase environmental resilience. Current projects investigate the
					unequal
					adaptation to flood risk in the United States and the distributional
					impacts of the flood insurance program, as well as the economic
					origins of
					inequalities in air pollution exposure. Prior to his doctoral studies,
					Jo worked as a consultant at the World Bank’s Environment and Natural
					Resources division. He holds masters in environmental sciences and
					environmental engineering from AgroParisTech, France.</li>
