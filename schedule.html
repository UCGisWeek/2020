											Pacific Railroad <em>Speaker: Michele
												Tobias, UC Davis</em></p>
										<p>The Central Pacific Railroad
											was an audacious Sacramento start-up in
											the 1860s. An early challenge for the
											company was figuring out a feasible route
											across the Sierra Nevadas. How did the
											route of the Central Pacific Railroad
											evolve from a mere concept to the busy,
											as-built track it is today? We describe
											our QGIS workflow and the technical
											challenges in georeferencing 21 historical
											maps of varying size, scale, and accuracy,
											across three time periods.</p>

											Understand Regional Traffic Patterns 
											<em>Speaker: Bingyu Zhao, UC Berkeley</em>
										</p>
										<p>In the field of large-scale
											traffic modeling, GIS becomes an
											indispensable tool in all stages of model
											development. However, many traffic
											engineers are not trained to be GIS
											specialists and GIS visualization
											frequently becomes the bottleneck in our
											research. In this poster, I will present
											some of our recent case studies that uses
											GIS tools (both conventional and new,
											browser-based) to visualize a variety of
											traffic phenomena and welcome advice in
											incorporating the most cutting-edge
											developments.</p>
										<p class="lead speaker">YES IN MY BACKYARD: A
											Spatial Analysis of ADU Interest in the
											City of San Diego <em>Speaker: Elizabeth
												Owen, UC Los Angeles</em></p>
										<p>The purpose of this research
											project is to visualize interest in
											accessory dwelling units within the City
											of San Diego’s neighborhoods. ADUs offer
											an incremental and scaled solution for
											increasing density in existing
											single-family neighborhoods that are in
											need of increased housing opportunities.
											The outcome of this research is a spatial

											affordable housing solution.</p>
										<p class="lead speaker">Visualizing
											Homelessness in Los Angeles  <em>Speaker:
												Claire Chua, UC Los Angeles</em></p>
										<p>Homelessness is a pressing issue faced by states all across America, particularly so in California. Although 
										homelessness in Los Angeles is especially visible, visualizing the magnitude of the homelessness crisis is not so 
										straightforward given the complex nature of the issue. This website strives to make visualizing the problem and 
										how we can begin to tackle it more evident through the use of mapping. A video explaining the cartography choices

											ArcGIS resources. There's no need to reach out to ask
											about getting
											access to licenses. With the elimination of the
											gate-keeper, we
											wanted to have a better idea of where users were coming
											from across
											campus. We created a dashboard to pull information from
											ArcGIS
											Online about our users and combined that with data from
											our campus

												Pereira, UC Los Angeles and Jared Schor, UC Los
												Angeles</em></p>
										<p>Using the Neighborhood Risk
											Index (NRI), an index comprised of 10
											indicators or risk factors, we measure how
											prevalent social and environmental risk
											factors are for children in a given city
											by presenting one dimensional maps of
											neighborhood risk levels classified by
											zero, low, medium, and high risk. We also
											display spatial patterns for each risk
											factor within city boundaries. These maps
											identify areas of opportunity in
											neighborhoods to positively influence
											child development.</p>

											by Social Determinants of Health Among Veterans in Veterans 
											Administration  <em>Speaker: Hoda S. Abdel Magid, Stanford</em></p>
										<p>The purpose of this study is to examine spatial disparities in COVID-19 
											testing and test positivity among Veterans enrolled in Veterans Affairs 
											Healthcare (VA). We calculate and map age-adjusted and race-stratified 
											age-adjusted testing rates for each county in the contagious US separately 
											for White Veterans and Black Veterans after adjusting for community-level 
											social determinants of health.  Rates were standardized to the nationwide 
											population of Veterans in active care at VA.</p>

										<p>This project was my first experience with ESRI's 
											new version of Story Maps. While Maria Jankowska 
											did the research, my co-worker and I were tasked 
											with transitioning the project to the new Story 
											Map Platform. It was challenging but the new user 
											interface is useful for creating an informative and 
											aesthetic project. We employed features such as the 
											sidecar function and dynamic web maps to complement 
											the static graphics. GIS programs are constantly 
											evolving and this project taught us to adapt.</p>
										<p class="lead speaker">Creating a Virtual,
											Spatial Map Room  <em>Speaker: Kian Tyler
												Carson, UC Los Angeles</em></p>
										<p>Considering the current global
											Coronavirus pandemic, physical map rooms
											are, at least temporarily a thing of the
											past. However, a global pandemic does not
											alleviate the demand for map viewers. Maps
											are required for many tasks including
											research and must continue to be available
											to the public. This virtual map room can
											provide viewers a way to safely find and
											view the maps they desire, without
											visiting physical map rooms that place
											them at risk for transmission of the
											virus.</p>	</blockquote>

										<p>In summer 2020, with all
											learning moved to virtual, I taught
											Introduction to GIS, an upper division
											course required for many majors, at UC
											Davis. Given the difficulties in giving
											tests and group work, I chose to
											emphasize project work. Student learned

											migrate from places that are not
											gay-friendly to gay-friendly places to
											find acceptance. We used archival data to
											examine migration patterns based on
											regional gay-friendliness, personal
											sexuality attitudes and sexual
											orientation. We observed gay migration in
											LG people migrating based on regional
											gay-friendliness, while the fit or misfit
											of personal attitudes and regional

										<p>Mapping Indigenous LA is a countermapping project based on the

										Indians who were displaced through governmental policies of relocation 
										and termination; and the Indigenous diasporas of Latin America and Oceania, 
										people displaced by militarism, neoliberal economic policies and overlapping 
										colonial histories. Our project features Indigenous community cartographies 
										that ask: How do those who have been here since time immemorial, for decades, 
										or newly arriving build and maintain indigenous identities, community, and 
										create alliances through overlapping geographies of Los Angeles? How do the 
										original peoples of the Los Angeles basin (and islands) relate specifically 
										to the land and how subsequent relocations and migrations of indigenous peoples 
										have reworked space, place, and meaning? In order to disseminate these previously 
										unexplored histories beyond the time frame of the project, we have developed a
