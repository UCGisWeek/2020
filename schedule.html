	                                     “pre-med” and life science peers has not
	                                     been easy. But the rocky start opened me
	                                     up to a new path of career and skill
	                                     interests that combines the best of both

	                                     my undergraduate journey in GIS and how I
	                                     plan to inspire others with my burning
	                                     curiosity and passion for this versatile
	                                     and promising discipline.</p>
